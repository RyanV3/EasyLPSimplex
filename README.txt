This program was made in and easily run in visual studio code.

When prompted to give the number of constraints and variables, simply type the single number and into the command line and enter.  The most sensitive part is entering
the information regarding the values for the constraints.  These values must be entered spaced out with no variables(example: for the constraints 6x1 + 4x2 <= 24
and x1 + 2x2 <= 6), you must enter "6 4 24 1 2 6").  Unfortunately, this project is not fully functional. The main issue with this project is getting the row 
operations to work as intended. I had a large amount of difficulty with this section and that is the reason it is not fully functioning. The function
that creates the correctly formatted list of all the data(before it is split up by the matrix creation formula) was a huge headache to make as well. It took a lot
of trial and error, but I am happy that it is working 100%.
